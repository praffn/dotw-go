# dotw:go

The rules are simple: a random date between two years is shown. Guess the weekday.

--------

Usage: <br>
`dotw [--from <from_year>] [--to <to_year>]`

`from_year` and `to_year` defaults to the current computer's year.
 
The random date is in the inclusive range January 1 of `from_year` to December 31 of `to_year`.
